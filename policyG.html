				Women who experience other forms of discrimination are often more likely to be paid
				even less and face additional barriers to employment and advancement. Greater

		 		<p class="policyp">
					- Progress pay equity and protect the requirement for equal pay (see Industrial Relations policy).
					<br>
					<br>
					- Include the value of unpaid work in our national economic statistics.
					<br>
					<br>
					- Develop employment legislation to increase the ability of workers to care for themselves and their dependants, for example child-friendly workplace provisions; breastfeeding breaks and areas; flexible working hours; increased
					sick and domestic leave provisions, and create protections from attack and
					negative employment consequences for victims of domestic violence in the
					workplace.
					<br>
					<br>
					- Extend paid parental leave (see Industrial Relations policy).
					<br>
					<br>
					- Work towards a social security system that treats people as individuals rather
					than couples, reduces stigma, respects and enables caring for children and
					other dependants and voluntary community work, and ensures the ability to participate in society for all.
					<br>
					<br>
					-  Review and reform the child support system to ensure it operates in a way to
					best benefit children and young people (see Children's policy).
					<br>
					<br>
					- Seek to raise the lowest incomes to ensure the ability to participate in society
					and reduce inequality, by:
					<br>
					<br>
					a) Raising the minimum wage.
					<br>
					<br>
					b) Improving the ability to bargain collectively.
					<br>
					<br>
					c) Addressing the casualisation of work.
					<br>
					<br>
					d) Reviewing remuneration for 
					traditional women's work.
					<br>
					<br>
					- Tailor equity initiatives to address all forms of discrimination such as ability,
					age, race.
