		 			Labour believes education gives our young people the freedom and opportunities to be the best they can be and contribute to making New Zealand an even better place to live.
		 			<br> 
		 			<br>
		 			National has chosen to undermine quality as a cost-saving measure. After nine years of being under resourced and overstretched, our education sector is under immense pressure and the quality of education is suffering. The result is a narrowing of the curriculum, more burnt out teachers, and falling tertiary education participation.
		 			<br>
		 			<br>
		 			More costs are being pushed on to parents and students. ECE fees have risen by an average of 25 per cent under National, while so called voluntary school donations have risen by 50 per cent. Tertiary fees are up over 40 per cent and student debt has topped $16 billion.
