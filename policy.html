		 			Labour will pass the legistation to implement this within our first 100 days in Office. The policy will be phased in over three years: 22 weeks from 2018 and 26 weeks in 2020.
		 		<br>
		 		<br>
		 			Getting to 26 weeks is an important goal. As well as the direct financial benefits to households, extending paid parental leave has a range of positive impacts in terms of child development and fostering parent-infant attachment. Extending Paid Parental Leave to twenty-six weeks (six months) would also align its duration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding uo to six months of age.
