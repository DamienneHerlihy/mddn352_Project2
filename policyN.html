					- Progressively extend Paid Parental Leave to 22 weeks over two years, with an initial step of 2 weeks on 1 July 2018 followed by a further two weeks on 1 July 2019
					<br>
					<br>
					- Add flexibility to Paid Parental Leave, by allowing both parents to take some of the 22 weeks off at the same time so they can be at home with their baby together
					<br>
					<br>
					- Support women to take care of their own health by offering them one free dental course during pregnancy and up to their babyâ€™s first birthday
					<br>
					<br>
					- Give more families a chance to have a baby by providing a third free IVF cycle, and speeding up access to fertility treatment for eligible couples
